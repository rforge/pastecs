# PASTECS

**PASTECS** stands for **package for the analysis of space-time ecological series**. It allows to transform an irregular time series into a relar one, and to analyze and decompose regular time series. It provides various S3 objects to ease the manipulation of time series.

It is a PNEC-Art4 and IFREMER (Benoit.Beliaeff@ifremer.fr) initiative to bring PASSTEC 2000 (http://www.obs-vlfr.fr/~enseigne/anado/passtec/passtec.htm) functionalities to R.
